The XS750-850 owners groups on facebook (both of them) are phenomenal resources for community support, wisdom, and advice. Huge thank you to them for helping me out with this project. 

Be very specific when searching for carburetor parts, and parts in general for these bikes. The early years are very different from the later years, the bikes underwent drastic changes later on. The ‘80s bikes don’t even share a top end. 

Second gear is known to go out, or have trouble engaging. Google XS750 second gear fix for a solution. 

1976-1977 XS 750s use Mikuni BS34 MK I carburetors. You can identify them by removing the float bowl and checking jet locations. 

The butterfly shaft seals in the carburetors go bad, ruining your mixture. Replace them with the U bend facing outwards. Be careful with the stock brass screws, they’re staked and soft. They love to strip. Use your whole bodyweight when loosening them. Use blue loctite when replacing them. Switch to stainless hex screws if you can. 

These bikes run best with the stock airbox. If that is not an option, you MUST use foam pod filters, otherwise the airflow through the carbs will be too turbulent for the diaphragms to work properly and your bike will run wrong. Avoid pleated K\&N style filters. 

Early model 750s use the same carburetors as XS650s of the same era, the 60s and up, roughly. 

Do not turn your early model XS750 into a cafe racer. They are not good platforms for that. They are top heavy and shaft driven, get a 650 to cut up.
